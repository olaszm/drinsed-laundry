        Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our team and
        customers. In light of the recent developments surrounding COVID-19, we
        feel it’s important to provide information and update you on measures we
        are implementing.
      </p>

      <h2>Steps we are taking</h2>
      <p>
        We have instructed all our cleaning and delivery teams to put anyone
        showing even mild symptoms on sick leave. <br />
        Alongside this we are instructing all Cleaning Centre Managers on
        ensuring good hygiene procedures and particularly, regular and thorough
        hand cleaning is adopted by the whole team both in the cleaning centre
        and on the road.
      </p>

      <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        The World Health Organization has said that the risk of transmission
        from packages is minimal, and are advocating the usage of delivery
        services to avoid overcrowding of public areas.
      </p>

      <ul>
        Please note, in accordance with prevention guidelines, we
        <b>cannot</b
        >:
        <li>
          Collect/clean items from people who are currently sick or recovering
          from COVID-19 (including people undergoing self-isolation due to mild
          symptoms)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contact-Free Collections and Deliveries</h2>

      <p>
        We are giving our customers and drivers the opportunity to request a
        Contact-Free collection/delivery. <br />
        Contact-Free collections-deliveries will work as follows:
      </p>

      <h3>Collections:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Driver arrives and informs customer through the intercom/by phone call
        </li>
        <li>Driver waits 2 meters from door</li>
        <li>Customer leaves items in front of door and closes it</li>
        <li>Driver collects items</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Delivery:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Driver arrives and informs customer through the intercom/by phone call
        </li>
        <li>
          Driver leaves items in front of door and waits 2 meters from door and
          waits to make sure they are collected
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you wish to request a Contact-Free collection/delivery, simply leave
        a note when placing your order through the website or app.
        <br />
        Should drivers wish to avoid contact, they will inform you at the point
        of collection/delivery.
      </p>

      <h3>Does laundry/dry cleaning kill the virus?</h3>
      <p>
        We’ve had a number of enquiries regarding this and we cannot confirm
        this with certainty. Our understanding is that laundering with detergent
        will likely remove any trace of the virus. In much the same way as
        washing hands, any trace of the virus would bond with the
        water/detergent solution and be rinsed away.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with regard to dry cleaning it is not as clear and there has
        been much less research in this regard, as dry cleaning isn’t used in a
        clinical setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, items that are ironed (either through standard ironing or
        steaming) undergo further sanitisation, which almost certainly will kill
        any virus/germs; all items we receive for dry cleaning or Wash & Press
        are ironed/steamed.
      </p>

      <h3>Elderly in self isolation</h3>

      <p>
        This is a particularly scary time for the older and more vulnerable in
        our society. If you know anyone who is over the age of 80 in self
        isolation (not due to symptoms) that usually has a carer visit to do
        their laundry, please refer them to our Customer Care Team and we will
        do a complimentary wash for them during the next couple of weeks.
